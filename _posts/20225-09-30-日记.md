# REFLECTION

Buried in deep confusion, I felt like just wandering in the sea without a neither a destination to go nor a diretion to follow. 

Nowaday's world is composed of noise and chaos. And I gradually find attaching to more information on the internet will only make myself deeper in a whirlpool. Daily assignments can not provide stulation for me to purchase things further or even near. So as usual, I just turn to compter games for an escape from the realistic world.

Fortunatelt, I didn't get into depression due to some great minds who can still provide me with inspiration and surrounding kind people who can warm me up.

I do come up with several ideas for my future recently. But I don't think I can just so simply write down here in a few words.

So maybe these ideas are worth trying. Similarly in the batterfield of Hearthstone, there is always wrong steps wether from a general view or not. But thats the progress that we are bound to go through. And I do believe that the puchasing progress will bring me peace of mind. So I want to say to myself that anyway it is worth to have a try.
